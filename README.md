TODO:
  1. add a way to provide the "API" instance but without authorization headers for "white listed" routes like /health and /users/sign-up
  2. Refactor folder structure to use files with names instead of using "index.js" like on "/webserver"
  3. Use published version of "axios-api-doc-generator" instead of symbolic link.
