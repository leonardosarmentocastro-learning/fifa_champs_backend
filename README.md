# 1. Introduction

This back-end project was developed to attend the necessities of the **"Giphy API"** code exercise, serving a `[GET] /gifs/random` endpoint.

### Technologies used

---

**Frameworks**

  - [express.js](http://expressjs.com/): Fast, unopinionated, minimalist web framework for Node.js;

**Environment variables**

  - [dotenv](https://www.npmjs.com/package/dotenv): Loads environment variables from a .env file into process.env;
  - [getenv](https://www.npmjs.com/package/getenv) Helper to get and typecast environment variables.

**Utility**

  - [axios](https://github.com/mzabriskie/axios): Promise based HTTP client for the browser and node.js (used for HTTP calls).

**Others**

  - [flickity](https://github.com/metafizzy/flickity): Touch, responsive, flickable carousels.

### Tools used

---

- [gulp](http://gulpjs.com/): Toolkit for automating painful or time-consuming tasks;
- [eslint](https://eslint.org/): The pluggable linting utility for JavaScript and JSX;

# 2. Development guide

### Requirements needed by your system

---

**Setup your environment**

This project relies on [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) as a development environment.

I recommend that you install it using [Node Version Manager (`nvm`)](https://github.com/creationix/nvm#installation);

### Running this application locally

---

After installing `Node.js`, there will be only three steps that you will need to do in order to run this application:

**1. Navigate to the project folder through**

```shell-script
cd spectrm_backend/
```

**2. Install all the project dependencies**

```shell-script
npm install
```

**3. Execute the npm `start` task**

```shell-script
npm start
```

And that is all!

**Best regards, Leonardo Sarmento de Castro.**
